# Unity Project: Buzz Purple Space Shooter (College Project)

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of my digital games college course.

## Project description

### Shooter-Up
The player controls the Buzz Purple ship and with several enemies with each peculiarity in their attacks, the focus of my programming in this project (my part of the project) was to try to make it as generic and expansive as possible with the time I had, thus being easy maintenance and creation of new enemies by catching combining behaviors and types of shots.

### Yellow ship: goes down the screen, shooting as it goes.
### Red ship: moves horizontally across the top of the screen, shooting a projectile that divides into 5 (the idea was for it to divide infinitely, but due to lack of time it was not possible to use ECS for this)
### Blue ship: descends from the top of the screen, shoots a projectile that goes up to the player's height at the moment of the shot and explodes
